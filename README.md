# ComposedUITests

This project contains an app that includes various UI tests used to validate the implementation of [Composed](https://github.com/opennetltd/Composed).

To run the app on-device first select a team in the Signing & Capabilities tab of the project settings.

Tests prefixed with `[Composed]` are implement using Composed, whereas tests implemented with `[Manual]` are implemented with the regular `UICollectionView` types and are used to validate an update before a fix is applied to Composed.
